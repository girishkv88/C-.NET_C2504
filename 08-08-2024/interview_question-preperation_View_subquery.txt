VIEWS AND SUBQUERY INTERVIEW QUESTION AND ANSWERS

*************************VIEWS***************************************
1.What is a view in SQL?

A view is a virtual table that is based on the result set of a SELECT query. . It does not store data physically but provides a way to simplify complex queries and enhance security.


2.Why use views?

To simplify complex queries.
To enhance security by restricting access to specific rows or columns.
To provide a consistent, abstracted view of the data.
To encapsulate logic and reuse SQL code.

3.How do you create a view?

sql

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

4.Can you update data through a view?

Yes, you can update data through a view if it is based on a single table and does not include any complex joins, aggregates, or group by clauses. The view must be updatable.

5.What are the limitations of views?

Views cannot have triggers.
Some views are read-only.
You cannot index a view directly (though we can create indexed views/materialized views in some databases).

6.What is the difference between a view and a table?

A table physically stores data, whereas a view is a virtual table representing the result of a query

7.How can you ensure security using views?

By creating views that expose only specific columns or rows of data to certain users, limiting their access to the underlying table data.	
9.How do you drop a view?


DROP VIEW view_name;

10What is an indexed view?

An indexed view, also known as a materialized view, is a view that has been physically stored in the database with an index, improving performance for certain types of queries.

***********************SUBQUERIES************************

1.What is a subquery in SQL?

A subquery is a query nested inside another query, used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data retrieved.

2.Where can subqueries be used?

In SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
In the WHERE, HAVING, and FROM clauses.

3.What are the types of subqueries?

Single-row subquery: Returns zero or one row.
Multiple-row subquery: Returns more than one row.
Correlated subquery: References columns from the outer query.

4.How do you use a subquery in the WHERE clause?

sql

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
WHERE column1 IN (SELECT column1 FROM table2 WHERE condition);

5.What is the difference between a subquery and a join?

A subquery is a query nested inside another query, often used to filter results or perform a calculation. A join combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

6.Write a query to create a view that shows the employee names and their department names.eg

CREATE VIEW EmployeeDepartment AS
SELECT e.EmployeeName, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
