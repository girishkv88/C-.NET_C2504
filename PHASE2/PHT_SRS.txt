(PHT)Personal Health Tracking.....SRSqns
.............
1. General Overview Questions

Q1: What is the primary purpose of the Personalized Health Tracker?
A1: The primary purpose of the Personalized Health Tracker is to help users monitor their daily health metrics, set personal health goals, track progress, and integrate data from wearable devices and health apps for personalized insights and notifications.

Q2: Who are the primary users of the application?
A2: The primary users are individuals interested in tracking and improving their health metrics, such as blood pressure, daily steps, weight, and other health goals. Healthcare professionals may also use it to monitor patients’ progress.

Q3: What are the main features of the application?
A3: The main features include:

Health goal setting and progress tracking.

Device integration and data synchronization with health apps.

Profile settings for managing user information and preferences.

Personalized health insights based on tracked data.


2. Functional Requirements Questions

Q4: How does the user set and track health goals?
A4: Users can set specific health goals (e.g., lower blood pressure, increase daily steps) through the Health Goals page. The system will track the user’s progress, and visual indicators like progress bars or charts will display their status.

Q5: What kind of notifications will users receive?
A5: Users will receive notifications related to their health goals, such as reminders to complete tasks, updates when goals are achieved, and warnings when their health metrics are not improving. These notifications can be configured in the profile settings.

Q6: How does the system integrate with external devices and apps?
A6: The system provides a list of supported devices (e.g., wearables, smartwatches, fitness trackers) and apps. Users can sync their data, and the app will periodically update and display their health data from those devices. There are also troubleshooting options for syncing issues.

3. Non-Functional Requirements Questions

Q7: What are the performance expectations for the application?
A7: The application is expected to handle real-time data from wearables and provide instant feedback to users. The user interface should remain responsive and load within 2-3 seconds, even with large amounts of data synced from external devices.

Q8: How is the data security and privacy handled?
A8: The application will employ encryption protocols to secure user health data. Users will have password protection for their profiles, and sensitive data (such as health metrics) will be stored securely, ensuring compliance with relevant data privacy regulations like HIPAA.

Q9: What platforms are supported for the Personalized Health Tracker?
A9: The application is a desktop-based WPF app, primarily targeting Windows users. Future versions may extend support for mobile and web platforms based on user demand.

4. Technical and Design Questions

Q10: What technologies are used to build the Personalized Health Tracker?
A10: The application is built using C#, WPF for the user interface, and SQL Server for storing user health data and profile information. Data synchronization with devices is handled through APIs provided by wearable manufacturers.

Q11: How is the user interface designed for flexibility and responsiveness?
A11: The UI uses a combination of Grid and Canvas layouts for flexibility. Elements such as health goals, progress indicators, and charts adjust dynamically to different screen sizes, ensuring a responsive user experience.

Q12: What database structure is used for storing user data?
A12: User data, including health metrics, goals, and progress, is stored in an SQL Server database. Each user has a profile, and their health metrics are recorded daily. Tables include Users, HealthMetrics, Goals, and DeviceSync.

5. Usability and User Interaction Questions

Q13: How does the application ensure ease of use for non-technical users?
A13: The application features an intuitive, user-friendly interface with clear labels and easy navigation. Users can quickly set goals, check progress, and access device synchronization settings without needing advanced technical skills. Visual cues like charts and progress bars enhance understanding.

Q14: How are errors or issues handled in the application?
A14: The application includes error handling for syncing issues with devices, invalid data entries (such as incorrect goal values), and failed login attempts. Users will be presented with user-friendly error messages and suggestions for troubleshooting.

6. Constraints and Assumptions Questions

Q15: What are the limitations of the current system?
A15: The system currently supports only certain wearable devices and health apps, limiting users to specific brands or services. Future updates may expand this list. Additionally, the application is desktop-only, which restricts mobility.

Q16: What assumptions were made during the development of the system?
A16: The system assumes that users will regularly update their health metrics either manually or through device sync. It also assumes that users have access to supported devices and apps for syncing their health data.

7. Future Enhancements Questions

Q17: What future enhancements are planned for the application?
A17: Planned enhancements include support for additional wearable devices, mobile app integration, cloud-based data storage for access across multiple devices, and more advanced health insights powered by AI.

Q18: Will there be any integration with healthcare providers?
A18: In future releases, the application may include integration with healthcare providers, allowing users to share their health data with doctors or receive professional recommendations based on their progress.

8. Testing and Validation Questions

Q19: How will the application be tested to ensure functionality?
A19: The application will undergo unit testing for each function, integration testing to ensure compatibility between modules (such as device sync and data storage), and user acceptance testing to validate that the system meets user needs and expectations.

Q20: How will data synchronization be validated?
A20: Data synchronization will be tested by simulating connections with supported devices. Tests will verify the accuracy and timeliness of data transfer, ensuring that the synced data reflects users' actual health metrics.
