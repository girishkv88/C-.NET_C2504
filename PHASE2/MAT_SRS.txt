10. Can doctors or pharmacists monitor patient adherence through the app?

Answer:
Yes, there is an optional feature that allows doctors or pharmacists to monitor their patients' adherence remotely. Healthcare professionals can view adherence reports, modify medication schedules, and send custom notifications to patients.

11. What non-functional requirements are critical for the application?

Answer:
Some important non-functional requirements include:

Performance: The application should handle multiple users and medication schedules without delay.

Reliability: The system must reliably send reminders and track medication adherence.

Usability: The user interface should be intuitive and accessible to patients of different technical skill levels.

Scalability: The system should support an increasing number of users without a decline in performance.

Security: User data must be protected through encryption and access controls.

12. How does the application handle missed doses?

Answer:
If a dose is missed, the system records it as such in the adherence tracking report. Patients can check-in late if they missed a reminder, but the adherence report will still show the delay. Doctors can use this data to monitor patient adherence more closely.

13. What are the possible future enhancements for the Medication Adherence Tracker?

Answer:
Possible future enhancements include:

Integration with wearable devices for automatic check-ins based on patient activity.

AI-powered adherence predictions to alert doctors if a patient is at risk of non-compliance.

Advanced reporting features for more detailed insights into adherence patterns.

Telemedicine features allowing patients to directly consult with healthcare providers through the app.
