To help you prepare questions and answers from the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for your "Digital Twin Visualization for Product Design" project, here are some possible areas of focus. These include questions about functionality, data management, user interactions, and system architecture based on the project description you provided.

1. What is the primary goal of the Digital Twin Visualization for Product Design application?

Answer: The primary goal of the Digital Twin Visualization for Product Design application is to provide engineers with a platform to create, simulate, and analyze virtual representations of physical products. By simulating real-world conditions, the application allows users to make data-driven design decisions, improve product quality, reduce development time, and foster collaboration among team members.

2. What are the key functional requirements of the application?

Answer: Key functional requirements include:

Creating and managing digital twins for various products.

Running simulations and monitoring performance metrics.

Storing and retrieving design specifications and simulation results.

Visualizing simulation outcomes with graphs, charts, and 3D models.

Facilitating design iterations based on simulation data.

Providing tools for collaboration, feedback, and version control.

Managing user roles, profiles, and system settings.



---

3. What technologies are used in the backend for data storage and management?

Answer: The backend data storage and management are handled using SQL Server. SQL Server is used to store digital twin models, simulation results, user accounts, and design iterations. The database also manages settings, collaboration information, and system logs related to product design and simulation.


---

4. How does the system manage simulations and their results?

Answer: The system manages simulations using the following processes:

Starting, pausing, or stopping simulations: Users can control the simulation flow via the Simulation Management Page.

Storing simulation results: Results, including metrics like stress tests and performance data, are saved in the SimulationResults table in SQL Server.

Displaying results: Users can view the results in a detailed format, such as graphs and 3D renderings, on the Performance Analysis Page.



---

5. What types of data are stored in the DigitalTwins table in the database?

Answer: The DigitalTwins table stores information related to the digital twin models, including:

TwinID: Unique identifier for each digital twin.

UserID: The user who created the digital twin.

Name: Name of the digital twin.

Description: A description of the digital twin.

ModelPath: File path for the 3D model associated with the digital twin.

CreatedAt and UpdatedAt: Timestamps for creation and updates.



---

6. How does the system handle design iterations?

Answer: Design iterations are managed through the Design Iteration Page and stored in the DesignIterations table in the SQL Server database. Each iteration includes the following:

IterationNumber: Tracks the version number of each design iteration.

ModifiedModelPath: File path of the modified design model.

Users can compare different versions of a design and revert to previous iterations if necessary.



---

7. What role does collaboration play in the application?

Answer: Collaboration is a key feature that allows multiple users to work together on digital twin projects. The Collaboration Page enables users to:

Share projects and simulation results with team members.

Provide comments and feedback on designs.

Track contributions and comments through the Collaboration table in SQL Server.



---

8. What user roles are supported, and how are they managed?

Answer: The system supports multiple user roles (e.g., admin, engineer). Each user’s role is stored in the Users table in SQL Server. Roles determine access permissions, such as:

Admins can manage user accounts, set system settings, and oversee projects.

Engineers can create digital twins, run simulations, and analyze results.

Roles and permissions are managed via the User Management Page.



---

9. How does the application ensure data security for user accounts?

Answer: The application ensures data security by:

Storing user passwords as hashed values in the Users table.

Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users can only access features they are authorized for.

Logging creation and updates to user accounts with timestamps (CreatedAt, UpdatedAt).



---

10. What are the non-functional requirements of the system?

Answer: Non-functional requirements include:

Performance: The system must handle multiple simulations and users concurrently without performance degradation.

Scalability: The system must scale to accommodate a growing number of digital twins and simulations.

Security: User data, designs, and simulation results must be protected against unauthorized access.

Usability: The interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate for users of different technical backgrounds.

Reliability: The system must ensure data integrity and recover from crashes or failures.



---

11. What types of simulations can the system run?

Answer: The system can run various types of simulations, including:

Stress tests

Thermal analysis

Flow simulations

Each simulation can be customized with parameters such as material properties and environmental conditions, and the results are visualized in real time.



---

12. How is version control managed within the system?

Answer: Version control is managed through the Design Iteration Page. Each version of a design is saved as a new iteration in the DesignIterations table. Users can:

Compare different iterations.

Revert to previous versions if necessary.

Track modifications based on simulation results.



---

13. What feedback mechanisms are available for users?

Answer: Users can provide feedback on the application through the Feedback Page. The feedback is stored in a Feedback table in SQL Server, allowing administrators to:

View user suggestions.

Address issues reported by users.

Make improvements based on feedback.



---

14. What are the system’s main constraints?

Answer: The main constraints include:

Data size limitations: Large 3D models and simulation data may require significant storage and processing power.

Real-time simulation processing: Depending on the complexity of the simulation, real-time performance may be limited by server and computational resources.

Concurrent user access: The system must ensure that multiple users can access and modify digital twins without causing conflicts.
