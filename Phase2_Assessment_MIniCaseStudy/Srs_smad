1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the software requirements for the Smart Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard. This project aims to develop an interactive dashboard that visualizes and aggregates manufacturing data to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), identify bottlenecks, and optimize production efficiency.

1.2 Scope

The Smart Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard is designed for manufacturing companies to monitor real-time data, generate reports, and analyze production performance. The system will integrate with SQL Server for data storage and will allow users to interact with live and historical data through visual charts and graphs.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

KPI: Key Performance Indicator

SQL: Structured Query Language

SRS: Software Requirements Specification

IoT: Internet of Things


1.4 Overview

This document contains the system's functional and non-functional requirements, describes the key modules of the system, and provides models and diagrams to explain the systemâ€™s flow and relationships.

2. System Description

2.1 Product Perspective

The Smart Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard will act as a web-based or desktop application that interacts with the manufacturing data stored in SQL Server. It will gather data from various production lines and machines, display them in an easy-to-understand format, and help decision-makers optimize production.

2.2 Product Features

Real-time monitoring of production data.

Data visualization through charts and graphs.

Bottleneck detection and analysis.

Alerts and notifications for production issues.

Report generation and export in multiple formats.

Integration with multiple data sources (IoT devices, ERP systems).

User role management and permissions.

Data storage in SQL Server.


2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

Admin: Manages user roles, system settings, and data sources.

Production Manager: Views production performance, generates reports, and tracks bottlenecks.

Operator: Monitors live data and responds to alerts.


2.4 Operating Environment

Software: SQL Server, WPF for UI, .NET Framework for backend, and possibly REST APIs for integration.

Hardware: Standard desktop or laptop with internet connection for real-time updates.

OS: Windows (for WPF desktop application).


2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

The system should be scalable to handle large data volumes.

The application will need a connection to SQL Server for data storage.

All communications with external systems should use secure protocols (HTTPS, SSL/TLS).

4. Non-Functional Requirements

4.1 Performance Requirements

The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with minimal lag.

Data queries should execute within 5 seconds under normal load.


4.2 Security Requirements

User data must be encrypted, both at rest and in transit.

Authentication should be enforced via role-based access control.

Data integrations with external sources must use secure APIs (HTTPS, OAuth).


4.3 Usability Requirements

The dashboard must be intuitive and accessible to non-technical users.

All reports and alerts should be easily understandable with minimal training.


4.4 Reliability and Availability

The system should maintain 99.9% uptime.

Data syncing should occur without data loss, even during downtimes or system restarts.
